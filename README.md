## Installation

If you want to run the app locally, we suggest you to create a separate virtual environment, and install all of the required dependencies there. Run in Terminal/Command Prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/lennertvanh/Thesis_Sofia_Lennert.git
cd Thesis_Sofia_Lennert
python3 -m venv thesisenv
```
In Windows: 

```
thesisenv\Scripts\activate
```

To install all of the required `pip` packages to this environment, simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, you're all set to locally run the app, which will be explained in the next section.
